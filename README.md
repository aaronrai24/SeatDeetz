//Student List

//Class creation screen
Set class name
Fix UI to display class once name is put in (up to 10 classes)

//Dashboard

//Seating Chart
- On button click in seat div, id value (which is student id) is not posting to getStudentInfo.php, need to find a way to query for studentInfo to fill in the student information form on seating chart
- Export functionality needs to be implemented
- Delete Seat button to be implemented in the student information section
- Cancel or exit button to be implemented in the student information section
