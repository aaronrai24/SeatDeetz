Idea: Use global variables to pull the primary key from current table.
For all other phps hardcoded to pull primary key of table, change
to pull the global from class switch.


Steps in process:
1) check if session variable holding the class exists, if not create it. 
2) if session variable holding the class is empty, assign it default value
(Perhaps create script that automatically does steps 1 and 2 at login, in login.php?)
3) assign selected class to the global variable.
4) update all the other phps so that they pull the global variable instead of hardcoded tables.

Schedule / Goals:
3/20: in register.php, write script to make 10 classes upon new user registering. In login.php, implement session variable (session variable = what class is selected)
    and enable default value of session variable (assign it to one of the 10 classes associated with the user)
3/21: UI: in ClassSelection.php, implement 10 buttons that display the 10 premade classes, display selected class on Dashboard, and ensure
    the different classes
